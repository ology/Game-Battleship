=head1 NAME

Game::Battleship::Craft - A Battleship craft class

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Game::Battleship::Craft;
  my $craft = Game::Battleship::Craft->new(
      id => 'T',
      name => 'tug boat',
      points => 1,
  )
  my $points_remaining = $craft->hit;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Game::Battleship::Craft> object represents the profile of a
Battleship

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 B<new> %ARGUMENTS

=over 4

=item * id => $STRING

A scalar identifier to use to indicate position on the grid.  If one
is not provided, the upper-cased first name character will be used by
default.

Currently, it is required that this be a single uppercase letter (the
first letter of the craft name, probably), since a C<hit> will be
indicated by "lower-casing" this mark on a player grid.

=item * name => $STRING

A required attribute provided to give the craft a name.

=item * points => $NUMBER

An attribute used to define the line segment span on the playing grid.

=item * position => [$X, $Y]

The position of the craft bow ("nose") on the grid.

Currently, the craft is assumed to have a horizontal or vertical
alignment.  Soon there will be diagonal positioning...

=back

=head2 B<hit()>

  $points_remaining = $craft->hit;

Increment the craft's C<hit> attribute value and return what's left of
the craft (total point value minus the number of hits).

=head1 TO DO

Have different numbers of different weapons.

Allow a craft to have a width.
