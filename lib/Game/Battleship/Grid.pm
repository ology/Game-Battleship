=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Game::Battleship::Grid;
  my $grid = Game::Battleship::Grid->new(
      fleet => \@fleet,
      dimension => [$width, $height],
  );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

A C<Game::Battleship::Grid> object represents a Battleship playing
surface complete with fleet position references and line intersection
collision detection.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 new

=over 4

=item * fleet => [$CRAFT_1, $CRAFT_2, ... $CRAFT_N]

Optional array reference of an unlimited number of
C<Game::Battleship::Craft> objects.

If provided, the fleet will be placed on the grid with random but
non-overlapping positions.

Naturally, it is required that the combined sizes of the ships be
less than the area of the grid.

=item * dimension => [$WIDTH, $HEIGHT]

Optional array reference with the grid height and width values.

If not provided, the standard ten by ten playing surface is used.

=back

=for Pod::Coverage BUILD

=head1 PRIVATE FUNCTIONS

=over 4

=item _tail_coordinates

  ($orientation, $x1, $y1) = _tail_coordinates($x0, $y0, $span);

Return a vector for the craft.  That is, hand back the vertical or
horizontal line segment orientation and the tail coordinates based on
the head coordinates and the length of the segment (i.e. the craft).

=item _segment_intersection

  $intersect = _segment_intersection(
      p_x0, p_y0,  p_x1, p_y1,
      q_x0, q_y0,  q_x1, q_y1
  );

Return zero if there is no intersection (or touching or overlap).

Each pair of values define a coordinate and each pair of coordinates
define a line segment.

=back

=head1 TO DO

Allow diagonal craft placement.

Allow placement restriction rules (e.g. not on edges, not adjacent,
etc.) as an arrayref of boundary equations or regular expressions.

Allow some type of interactive craft re-positioning.

Allow > 2D playing spaces.
